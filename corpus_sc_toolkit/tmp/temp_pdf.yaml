  text: "\n\n\n\nZALAMEDA, J.: \n\n\n             Faithful  observance  of  the  rules\
    \  provided  under  Section  21  of \n        Republic  Act  (RA)  No.  9165,\
    \  otherwise  known  as  the  \"Comprehensive \n        Dangerous  Drugs  Act\
    \  of  2002\"  is  always  desirable  from  our  police \n        authorities.\
    \  Nevertheless, the evils sought to be avoided by these rules are \n\n      \
    \  obviated when the dangerous drugs recovered are of large quantities.  Thus,\
    \ \n        while we still strongly encourage our police to strictly follow the\
    \ rules on chain of custody, we will generally not prevent the arms of our law\
    \ from reaching large-scale peddlers of dangerous drugs by the simple reason that\
    \ departures from said rules were committed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \
    \                The Case \n\n\n             This  Court  resolves  an  appeal\
    \  assailing  the  Decision1  dated  04\n\n\n\nSeptember 2015,  of the  Court\
    \ of Appeals  (CA)  in CA-G.R.  CR-HC No. \n        061 71  which  affirmed  the\
    \  Judgment2  dated  15  April  2013  rendered  in \n        Criminal  Case  No.\
    \  08-0517  of the  Regional  Trial  Court,  Branch  259, \n       Parafiaque\
    \  City  (RTC),  finding  Chih  Chien  Yang  (Yang)  guilty  beyond \n\n     \
    \  reasonable doubt of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165, and sentencing him to\
    \ suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Pl ,000,000.00.\
    \ \n\n\n\n                                Antecedents \n\n\n             In an\
    \ Information dated 21 April 2008, Yang was charged of illegally \n        possessing\
    \ 9.9 kilograms ofKetamine Hydrochloride. The accusation reads: \n\n\n       \
    \          That on or about the 19th day of April, 2008 in the City of Parafiaque,\
    \ \n            above-named accused, not being authorized by law to possess, did\
    \ then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession\
    \ and under his control and custody Ketamine Hydrochloride weighing 9.9 Kilograms,\
    \ a dangerous drug. \n\n\n\n\n\n                 CONTRARY TO LAW.3 \n\n      \
    \       When arraigned, Yang pleaded not guilty. 4  Thus, trial on the merits\
    \ \n\n        followed, during which the prosecution offered the following version\
    \ of the events that led to Yang's arrest: \n\n\n\n                  At around\
    \ 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 19 April 2008, a team \n             composed\
    \  of  police  operatives  from  the  Anti-Illegal  Drugs  Special \n        \
    \     Operations  Task  Force  (AIDSOTF)  from  Camp  Crame,  Quezon  City, \n\
    \             headed  by  Police  Chief  Inspector  Rommel  Ochave  went  to \
    \ Yang's \n             residence at No. 19-B Humility St., Multinational Village,\
    \ Parafiaque City, to implement a \xB7 search warrant dated 18 April 2008 issued\
    \ by Manila Executive Judge Reynaldo G. Ros of the RTC of Manila, Branch 33, for\
    \ probable violation of Section 11 of R.A. No. 9165. The group was likewise am1ed\
    \ with a warrant of arrest dated 21 May 2007 issued by Judge Catherine Manodon\
    \ of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 43, against Yang for\
    \ probable violation of Article 172, in relation to Article 175 (paragraph 4)\
    \ of the Revised Penal Code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Upon entering\
    \  Humility  Street,  Multinational Village,  Parafiaque \n             City,\
    \ the police operatives spotted Yang driving his black Toyota Innova which they\
    \ tried to flag down. However, instead of stopping, Yang sped off prompting the\
    \ team to gave chase until he was cornered at the gate of Multinational Village,\
    \ Parafiaque City. The police operatives then instructed Yang to alight from his\
    \ vehicle, showed him the Warrant of Arrest, and effected his arrest. PO3 Nabarte,\
    \ together with PO2 De Guzman, PO2\n\n\n\nCubyan and Yang,  boarded the  Toyota\
    \ Innova and proceeded to  Yang's \n             residence  to  implement the\
    \  Search Warrant  while  the  rest  of the  team \n\n             followed. \
    \ Upon  their  arrival  thereat,  and  in  the  presence  of Barangay \n     \
    \        Kagawads  Espiritu  and  Cristobal  who  were  summoned  to  witness\
    \  the \n             search,  the  police  operatives presented the  search \
    \ warrant  to  Yang  and \n             informed him of the purpose of the search\
    \ and his constitutional rights. \n\n                  Afterwards, the police\
    \ operatives, together with Yang and Barangay \n             Kagawads  Espiritu\
    \  and  Cristobal,  entered  Yang's  two-storey  house  and \n             started\
    \  searching  the  ground  floor  but  found  nothing.  They  proceeded \n   \
    \          thereafter to the second floor and the police operatives started searching\
    \ the master's bedroom and middle room, but no illegal drugs were likewise found.\
    \ However, the police operatives found a room at the right portion of the second\
    \ floor which was locked with a fingerprint scanner, so the police operatives\
    \ requested Yang to open the said room. Thereat, the PO3 Nabarte recovered a white\
    \ paper bag labelled \"VNC\" and inside of which was a transparent plastic bag\
    \ labelled \"TBY SHOP.COM\". The said transparent plastic bag, on the other hand,\
    \ contained a yellow SM plastic bag which contained two (2) transparent bags of\
    \ powdery white substance suspected to be Ketamine. PO3 Nabarte then placed the\
    \ marking \"JENN\" and the date on the recovered pieces of evidence inside the\
    \ room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  After searching Yang's house,\
    \  the police  operatives proceeded to \n             search the Toyota Innova\
    \ driven by Yang, still in the latter's presence and Barangay Kagawads Espiritu\
    \ and Cristobal. When the police operatives opened the trunk, PO3 Nabarte recovered\
    \ two (2) travelling bags. The first bag was colored black and gray, with label\
    \ \"Structure Sport\" which was immediately marked by PO3 Nabarte as EXH B JENN\
    \ 04-19-18. Inside the said bag were three (3) plastic bags tied with straw, which\
    \ they also marked as EXH B-1 JENN 04-19-18, EXH B-2 JENN 04-19-18, and EXH B-3\
    \ JENN 04-19-18 . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 . The second bag was colored\
    \ black and blue, with label \"Hilfiger,\" \n             which was immediately\
    \ marked by PO3 Nabarte as EXH C JENN 04-19. Inside the said bag were two (2)\
    \ transparent plastic bags tied with straw and containing white powdery substance.\
    \ PO3 Nabarte marked the plastic bags with EXH C-1 JENN 04-19-18 and EXH C-2 JENN\
    \ 04-19-18. \n\n\n\n\n\n                  The police operatives also recovered\
    \ machines used to produce credit \n             cards. They then conducted a\
    \ physical inventory of the confiscated items and also took pictures thereof.\
    \ Barangay Kagawad Espiritu subsequently issued a Certification of orderly search\
    \ relative to the implementation of the search warrant, which Yang refused to\
    \ sign. PO3 Nabarte, on the other hand, issued four (4 ) Receipts of Property\
    \ Seized enumerating all of the foregoing confiscated items, which were signed\
    \ by Barangay Kagawads Espiritu and Cristobal. PO3 Nabarte likewise issued a Certificate\
    \ of Orderly Search signed by Barangay Kagawads Espiritu and Cristobal. Yang,\
    \ however, refused to sign said Certificate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \
    \      Thereafter,  Yang  was  brought to  Can1p  Crame,  Quezon  City,  for \n\
    \             booking and investigation together with the confiscated items. The\
    \ police operatives likewise returned thereat. At the said office, a representative\
    \ from the Department of Justice in the person of Prosecutor Manabat was waiting.\
    \ The police operatives then showed the confiscated items to Prosecutor\n\n\n\n\
    Manabat. The police operatives likewise prepared a Request for Laboratory Examination\
    \ for the confiscated items. Together with the request, all of the foregoing seized\
    \ items were submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory by PO3 Nabarte. \n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \             Forensic Chemist Abad of the PDEA Laboratory Service, who received\
    \ the seized items, conducted a laboratory examination on the said items. From\
    \ among the specimens submitted for chemical examination, only the bag of white\
    \ crystalline substance marked as EXH C-2 JENN 04-19-18 gave positive result for\
    \ Ketamine Hydrochloride, while the rest tested negative for dangerous drugs as\
    \ contained in her Final Chemistry Report No. DD-073-0820 dated 20 April 2008.5\
    \ (Citations omitted) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Meanwhile,  Yang  gave  a\
    \  completely  different  re-telling  of what \n        transpired. Thus: \n\n\
    \n                  At around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 19 April 2008,\
    \ Yang was \n             about to leave his house enroute [sic] to Angeles City,\
    \ Pampanga, to bring computers and laptops when he noticed several persons and\
    \ vehicles outside his house. He was ordered to stop but fearing that it might\
    \ be a kidnapping situation, Yang drove towards the gate of the village to report\
    \ to the security guards the incident and that he was being followed. The security\
    \ guards informed Yang that the men following him introduced themselves as policemen.\
    \ The police officers then informed Yang that he was driving a carnapped vehicle\
    \ and was asked to produce the official receipt and certificate of registration.\
    \ After handing over to the police officers the papers of the vehicle, Yang was\
    \ handcuffed and was driven around Multinational Village. He then noticed that\
    \ his car was no longer there. After half an hour, the police officers brought\
    \ Yang to his house where he was shown a search warrant. He was directed to open\
    \ his house where his wife, child, and househelp were. Upon entering his house,\
    \ Yang saw computers and laptop which, he was told, were to be used as evidence\
    \ against him. After being informed of the procedure of the search, the police\
    \ officers started to search the entire house. Later, Yang was handed the car\
    \ key and was asked to open the doors. When he opened the trunk, he was surprised\
    \ to see bags instead of the computers and laptops that were supposedly inside\
    \ the trunk. The bags were opened by the police operatives and Yang was informed\
    \ that the said bags contained drugs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n                  Yang further testified that he was taken to  Camp Crame,\
    \  Quezon \n\n             City, where the police operatives demanded Php 10,000,000.00\
    \ from him. When his lawyer arrived, the latter was able to negotiate and lower\
    \ the amount being demanded to Php 1,000,000.00 in exchange for the dropping of\
    \ the case against Yang. The latter's godmother, Evelyn Sy Ting, provided the\
    \ amount of Php 1,000,000.00. Yang's girlfriend, Mary Jane Gloria, saw his lawver\
    \ hand over the said amount of the police officers. Yang also testified that he\
    \ had a p1:ior case in Quezon City involving credit cards but this was dismissed.6\
    \ (Citations omitted)\n\n\n\nRuling of the RTC \n\n\n             After trial,\
    \  the RTC  rendered judgment finding Yang guilty beyond \n\n        reasonable\
    \  doubt  of violating  Section  11,  Article  II  of RA 9165. 7  The \n     \
    \   dispositive portion of the decision reads: \n\n\n                  WHEREFORE,\
    \  premises  considered,  this  Court  finds  accused \n             CHIH CHIEN\
    \ YANG in Criminal Case No.  08-0517, GUILTY beyond \n             reasonable\
    \  doubt  for  Violation  of  Sec.  11,  Art.  II,  R.A.  9165  and \n       \
    \      considering the weight of ketamine hydrochloride found in his possession\
    \ which is 9.9 kilograms, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life\
    \ imprisonment and to pay a fine of Php 1,000,000.00. \n\n\n\n               \
    \   Further  it  appearing  that  the  accused  CHU-I  CHIEN  YANG  is \n    \
    \         detained at the Metro Manila District Jail (MMDJ), Special Intensive\
    \ Care Area (SICA), Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City and considering the penalty\
    \ imposed, the OIC-Branch Clerk of Court is hereby directed to prepare the Mittimus\
    \ for the immediate transfer of said accused from the MMDJ-SIC to the New Bilibid\
    \ Prisons, Muntinlupa City. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  The representative\
    \ sample of the ketamine hydrochloride subject of \n             this case is\
    \ forfeited in favor of the government and the OIC-Branch Clerk of Court is likewise\
    \ directed to immediately turn over the same to the Philippine Drug Enforcement\
    \ Agency (PDEA) for proper disposal pursuant to Sec. 21 of RA 9165 and Supreme\
    \ Court OCA Circular No. 51-2003. \n\n\n\n\n\n                  SO ORDERED. 8\
    \ \n\n\n             The RTC  found Yang's defense of denial and frame-up too\
    \ weak to \n        overcoin_e  the  presumption  of regularity  in  the  performance\
    \  of duties \n\n        extended in favor of the police officers. It was pointed\
    \ out that personalities that were allegedly present during his arrest and could\
    \ testify as to its irregularity were not presented as witnesses by the defense.\
    \ The trial court, nevertheless, acknowledged that it was the prosecution that\
    \ had the burden to prove Yang's guilt considering that the latter enjoys the\
    \ presumption of innocence. On this score, the RTC was convinced that the prosecution\
    \ was able to discharge this burden. The RTC gave credence to the testimonies\
    \ of the police officers narrating what had transpired during the implementation\
    \ of the arrest warrant and search warrant issued against Yang. Also, while the\
    \ RTC observed some departure from the requirements prescribed in Section 21 of\
    \ RA 9165, the court did not see this as fatal for the prosecution as there was\
    \ substantial compliance with the law and the integrity and evidentiary\n\n\n\n\
    value of the seized items were preserved.  All told, the RTC found that all \n\
    \       the elements of the crime charged were established by the prosecution.\
    \ 9 \n\n\n            Aggrieved, Yang appealed his conviction to the CA. \n\n\n\
    \                              Ruling of the CA \n\n\n             The CA, in\
    \ its assailed Decision 10 dated 22 December 2011, affirmed \n        the RTC's\
    \ ruling and disposed of Yang's appeal in this manner: \n\n\n                \
    \  WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Appeal is DENIED. \n          \
    \   The Decision dated 15 April 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Parafiaque\
    \ City, Branch 259, in Criminal Case No. 08-0517, is hereby AFFIRMED. \n\n\n \
    \                 SO ORDERED. 11 \n\n\n             The CA agreed  with the trial\
    \  court that the  elements  of the  crime \n\n        charged  was  fully  established.\
    \  It  was  shown  that  Yang  had  free  and \n        conscious constructive\
    \ possession of the  seized drugs without having any \n        legal authority\
    \ for such possession. The CA also found no reason to interfere with the factual\
    \ findings of the RTC with regard to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.\
    \ As for the defenses that Yang offered, the CA found them underwhelming to defeat\
    \ the evidence presented to prove his guilt. The appellate court is in accord\
    \ with the RTC that in the absence of clear and \n\n\n\n\n\n        convincing\
    \ proof that the police officers had ill motive to implicate Yang, their testimonies\
    \ with respect to the implementation of the warrants must be given full faith\
    \ and credence. The CA also saw as unbelievable Yang's story \n\n\n\n        of\
    \ extortion.  Considering the seriousness of the allegation, Yang failed to \n\
    \        substantiate the same by evidence.  Further, the alleged extortion is\
    \ belied by \n        the  certification  issued  by the  barangay  officials\
    \  attesting to  the  orderly \n\n        implementation of the search warrant.\
    \ 12 \n\n\n             Yang now comes before the Court appealing the CA's affirmance\
    \ of \n        his conviction.  When required to submit their respective briefs,\
    \ 13  both Yang \n        and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) manifested\
    \ their lack of desire \n        to do so.14\n\n\n\nIssue \n\n\n\n           \
    \  The  sole  issue  for  this  Court's  resolution  is  whether  Yang  was \n\
    \        correctly convicted for violating Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.\
    \ \n\n\n             In his Brief for the Accused-Appellant15 which he filed before\
    \ the CA, \n        Yang merely claimed that he was illegally arrested without\
    \ a warrant and thus, the evidence secured from the warrantless arrest should\
    \ be considered inadmissible.16 \n\n\n\n\n\n                              Ruling\
    \ of the Court \n\n\n             We affirm Yang's conviction. \n\n\n        \
    \     At the onset, Yang's assertion that he was illegally arrested without a\
    \ \n        warrant was already addressed adequately by the CA.  We agree with\
    \ the CA \n        that apart from the search warrant against him, the police\
    \ officers were also implementing an arrest warrant issued in connection with\
    \ another criminal charge for Estafa he was facing. These warrants are on record\
    \ and presented in evidence. 17 Thus, there is no reason to doubt the truth about\
    \ the legality of Yang's arrest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             More importantly,\
    \ We  find no reason to disturb the RTC's and CA's \n\n        uniform n:1.ling\
    \ that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the crime of\
    \ illegal possession of dangerous drugs. In illegal possession of dangerous drugs,\
    \ the elements are: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which\
    \ is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized\
    \ by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.18\
    \ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Here, it was shown that Yang had in his free\
    \ and conscious possession, \n        9.9  kilograms  of powdery  white  substance\
    \  that  later  tested  positive  for \n        ketamfne hydrochloride.  Indeed,\
    \ the  seized drug was recovered from the \n\n        vehicle that Yang was seen\
    \ driving. \n\n\n             The  fact  that  ketamine  hydrochloride  is  a\
    \  dangerous  drug  is  also \n        established.  According to the World Health\
    \ Organization (WHO), misuse \n        and  abuse  of  Ketamine  Hydrochloride\
    \  have  the  following  mam\n\n\n\nneurobehavioral effects: anxiety, agitation,\
    \ changes of perception ( e.g. loss of notion of danger, visual disturbances),\
    \ and, disorientation and impairment \n\n       of  motor  functions,  such  as\
    \  ataxia  and  dystonic  reaction.  In  these \n        conditions,  the  intoxicant's\
    \  self-control  is  drastically  impaired,  rendering \n\n        said person\
    \ a potential source of physical harm or injury, not only to himself or herself,\
    \ but also to others. Other common side-effects also include: slurred speech,\
    \ dizziness, blurred vision, palpitations, chest pains, vomiting, and insomnia.19\
    \ News reports also described that in smaller doses, Ketamine Hydrochloride produces\
    \ a mild and dreamy feeling. However, hallucinogenic effects happen when large\
    \ quantities are consumed. 20 In 2005, the Dangerous Drugs Board issued Board\
    \ Resolution No. 3, s. 2005, classifying ketamine hydrochloride as a dangerous\
    \ drug.21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Finally,  Yang  failed  to  show \
    \ any  lawful  authority  to  possess  the \n\n        confiscated ketamine. \n\
    \n\n             The Court also agrees with the RTC that despite of the police\
    \ officer's \n        failure to observe fully the requirements under Section\
    \ 21  of RA 9165, the \n        prosecution was able to prove the corpus delicti\
    \ of the crime. \n\n\n             Indeed,  in  every  prosecution  of violations\
    \  of RA  9165,  including \n        illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the\
    \ prosecution is mandated to present the corpus delicti of the crime, i.e., the\
    \ seized drugs, as evidence in court. Concomitantly, the prosecution has the burden\
    \ to prove beyond reasonable \n\n\n\n        doubt the identity of the dangerous\
    \ drugs by showing that the drugs offered in court as evidence were the same substances\
    \ bought or recovered from the \n\n        accused.22 \n\n\n\n             In\
    \ this regard, the chain of custody rule embodied in Section 21  of RA \n    \
    \    9165 was designed precisely to ensure that all the rights of the accused\
    \ are guaranteed and the credibility of the corpus delicti safeguarded. 23 Part\
    \ of the chain of custody rule, RA 9165 requires that the marking, physical \n\
    \n\n\n        inventory,  and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately\
    \ \n        after the seizure and confiscation of the same. It was made compulsory\
    \ that the physical inventory and photograph-taking be done in the presence of\
    \ the\n\n\n\naccused  or  the  person  from  whom  the  items  were  seized, \
    \ or  his \n        representative or counsel, as well these required witnesses:\
    \ (a) if prior to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 1064024 on 07 August 2014,25\
    \ \"a representative from the media AND the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any\
    \ elected public official\"; or (b) if after said amendment, \"[an] elected public\
    \ official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service OR the media.\"\
    \ These witnesses were required by law specifically \"to ensure the establishment\
    \ .of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or\
    \ contamination of evidence.\"26 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Here, the\
    \ criminal act was committed on 19 April 2008 or before the \n        amendment\
    \ of RA 9165. Thus, aside from the accused or his representative, three (3) specific\
    \ witnesses were required during the conduct of inventory and photograph-taking\
    \ of the seized drugs. However, it appears that in the present case, there were\
    \ no representatives from the media and the DOJ present as witness to these procedures.\
    \ Only the three (3) barangay officials witnessed the conduct of inventory and\
    \ photograph-taking of the seized items; and while a DOJ representative later\
    \ on appeared in the Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force office and\
    \ saw the seized items, this hardly satisfies the requirement under Section 21\
    \ of RA 9165. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Nonetheless, this Court fmd\
    \ this misstep not fatal for the prosecution's \n        cause.  In People v.\
    \  Lung Wai Tang, 27 the Court held that the large quantity \n        of d,rugs\
    \  seized renders  unlikely the  possibility  of planting  or tampering \n\n \
    \       evidence. Thus: \n\n                  This Court finds unreliable accused-appellant's\
    \ version that he was \n\n             merely framed-up.  The considerable quantity\
    \ of seized drugs totaling 7.9 \n             kilograms renders his claim that\
    \ the seized drugs were planted by the police officers difficult to believe. Unlike\
    \ miniscule amounts, a large quantity of drugs worth millions is not as susceptible\
    \ to planting, tampering, or \n\n\n             alteration[.] \n\n           \
    \                          XXX \n\n                  Strict adherence to the procedural\
    \ safeguards is required where \n             the quantity of illegal drugs seized\
    \ is small, since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering, or alteration\
    \ of evidence. On the other hand, large amounts of seized drugs are not as easily\
    \ planted, tampered, or manipulated. Here, the considerable quantity of shabu\
    \ consisting of\n\n\n\nalmost eight (8) kilograms provides strong probative value\
    \ favoring the . prosecution's version of events. (Emphasis supplied) \n\n\n\n\
    \            In  a  similar  fashion,  the  drugs  found  in Yang's  possession\
    \  are  of \n        considerable  amount,  weighing  9.9  kilograms.  The  evil\
    \  sought  to  be \n        prevented by a strict adherence to the procedural\
    \ safeguards under RA 9165 is not present here. Thus, the Court finds it proper\
    \ to apply in this case the pronouncements made in Lung Wai Tang. \n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \            Further, the Court notes that in the course of serving the search\
    \ and \n        arrest  warrants  against  accused-appellant  at the  specified\
    \  location  of the \n        search,  the  police  officers  spotted  accused-appellant\
    \  driving  his  vehicle. \n        When flagged down, accused-appellant tried\
    \ to evade the police officers by speeding away, and a chase then ensued. Accused-appellant\
    \ was finally \n\n\n        apprehended  at  the  gate  of  Multinational  Village.\
    \  Jurisprudence  has \n        repeatedly  declared that flight  is  an  indication\
    \  of guilt.  The  flight  of an \n        accused, in the absence of a credible\
    \ explanation, would be a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be\
    \ established for a truly innocent person would normally grasp the first available\
    \ opportunity to defend himself and assert his innocence.28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \
    \          More  importantly,  the testimonies  of the key prosecution witnesses\
    \ \n        Police  Officer  3  Jose  Nabarte  (P03  Nabarte)  and  Philippine\
    \  Drug \n        Enforcement Agency Chemist Maria Criser Abad (PDEA Chemist Abad),\
    \ were able to account for the movement and condition of the seized drug from\
    \ the time of seizure up until its presentation in court. They testified: \n\n\

    \    Q:   Who  were  inside  the  Innova where  the  evidence  recovered  was\
    \ \n                  placed? \n             A:   The suspect, myself, and the\
