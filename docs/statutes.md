# Statutes

## Statute Extraction

The [statute-trees](https://github.com/justmars/statute-trees) and [statute-patterns](https://github.com/justmars/statute-patterns) libraries are help fashion content into nested provisions. These are also used in determining whether an decision's opinion contains references to a statute.
